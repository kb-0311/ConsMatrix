During the Government Public Works Tender allocation, the tenders, as well as the potential contractors, are classified into 7 levels - Class A, Class B ..etc according to the total capital, expertise, etc. In Class A subset of contractors, in particular, are usually shortlisted for contracts around 200+ Cr which are under the mega-sized Build-Order-Transfer (BOT)category of contracts (e.g. constructing a bridge over water bodies).

Now, When the bidders are finalized for a BOT project, after all the initial verification, EMD, etc are done then part A of Tender (Technical evaluation) is scheduled where the potential contractor is evaluated by the quality of their utilities, pieces of machinery, and a working prototype sample on which unit test, heat test are all performed as well as 3rd party consultancies are asked to perform their own assessment on the above for each bidder.

All the tests have a score and their avg is the technical score for Part A of the tender for that bidder before progressing to the Financial round (Part B of the tender)//(expand when necessary). Those who fail even one test according to their score are disqualified. 

This Score is then displayed behind closed doors to the bidder away from the public unless someone goes through the hassle of RTI and even then only one person gets to check that out. 

Now, these class A contractors are limited in number and they only have to purchase utilities to just surpass the bare minimum and compete with very very few contractors who too, are trying to only surpass the minimum score for BOT projects to maximize the profit margins. This not only harms public interest but also puts a ceiling cap on what quality of utilities can be provided for public works.

## How will this project be of any help?

For Completed BOT projects, The testing score after all the performed tests on a given utility of a given contracting company in a given public works sector can be allowed to be input by the authorized Government tester as well as 3rd party consultancy (which I mentioned previously) with an optional review which can be added by them on the working quality of that companies utilities in their inventory. 

Also If all the checks have passed for a given utility there is an approval count which can be added by the authorized tester and will be updated in real-time.

There would also be a government admin role who can create, update, get, and delete utilities, private contractors, and users in the database as and when necessary for the Public Works Department. 


Most importantly, the general public as in the non-authorized users can see/search for a given company, a sector, a utility in a given price range and get all the reviews/approval count / which contractor it belongs to and where it was utilized for the given utility. This will keep the quality of the utilized toolkits in public works under direct public scrutiny. 
A leaderboard section where rankings are based around an aggregate score of a company in a sector calculated on all of their scores assigned by the testers on their utilities which they have used in public works. All the contractors in a sector are directly compared in this way. The public (non-auth users are free to look up this section too)


Both of these features are implemented to put pressure on the contractors to keep the quality of their pieces of machinery etc up by bringing their inventoryâ€™s quality absolute score a subject to public scrutiny but also the relative score of their inventory with respect to other contractors in their sector which the public can view at any time. So this introduction will make sure that the contractor utilities are of excellent quality.
